Learning ML on MNIST dataset

Steps:

1. Learn about the data. Visualize it with graphs and understand them thoroughly.

2. Rescale and normalize the data.

3. Create a simple Sequential model to overfit the data. 

4. Add more Dense layers.

5. Apply regularization method like Dropout.

6. Test out different optimizers.

7. Use callbacks to define a custom lr scheduler.

8. Apply data augmentations.

9. Let the model keep running!
